```

### 🔍 **UNDERFITTING DETECTION & RESOLUTION**

#### **Automatic Detection Checks:**
- ✅ Training accuracy monitoring (target >90%)
- ✅ Train-validation gap analysis (target <5%)
- ✅ Prediction confidence tracking (target >80%)
- ✅ Loss plateau detection
- ✅ Per-class performance balance

#### **Resolution Strategies Applied:**
1. **Model Capacity**: Increased dense layers and neurons
2. **Regularization**: Reduced dropout rates strategically  
3. **Learning Rate**: Higher initial rates (1e-3 vs 1e-4)
4. **Training Time**: Extended with two-phase approach
5. **Data Quality**: Enhanced augmentation pipeline

### 📈 **TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE**

#### **If Underfitting Still Occurs:**

**🔧 Model Architecture Fixes:**
```python
# Increase capacity further
x = layers.Dense(1024, activation='relu')(x)  # Increase to 1024
x = layers.Dropout(0.1)(x)                    # Reduce dropout to 0.1

# Add more layers
x = layers.Dense(512, activation='relu')(x)
x = layers.Dense(256, activation='relu')(x)
x = layers.Dense(128, activation='relu')(x)
```

**📚 Training Strategy Fixes:**
```python
# Increase epochs
phase1_epochs = 35  # Increase from 25
phase2_epochs = 25  # Increase from 15

# Higher learning rates
phase1_lr = 2e-3    # Increase from 1e-3
phase2_lr = 2e-5    # Increase from 1e-5
```

**🔄 Data Strategy Fixes:**
```python
# Stronger augmentation
A.ShiftScaleRotate(rotate_limit=45, p=0.8)  # Increase rotation
A.RandomBrightnessContrast(brightness_limit=0.6, p=0.8)  # Stronger

# Collect more data or use external datasets
# Consider synthetic data generation
```
